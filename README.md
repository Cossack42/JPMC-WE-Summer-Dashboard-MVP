# JPMC-WE-Summer-Dashboard-MVP
During the JP Morgan Work Experience Program, my team, “The Fintech Sorcerers,” built a proof of concept in a four-hour hackathon.

With no previous experience using JavaScript or Bootstrap, we created an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that impressed a panel of judges. Our web application is designed to inspire summer activities for young people: users open the site, receive a random weather-informed suggestion, and can dive into something fun.

We pitched our idea to a board of judges and ultimately won the hackathon.
