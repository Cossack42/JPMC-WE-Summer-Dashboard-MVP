# JPMC-WE-Summer-Dashboard-MVP
During the JP Morgan Work Experience Program, my team, “The Fintech Sorcerers,” built a proof of concept in a four-hour hackathon.

With no previous experience using JavaScript or Bootstrap, we created an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that impressed a panel of judges. ur web application is designed to inspire summer activities for young people: users open the site, get a suggestion informed by local weather conditions (via a Weather API), and then dive into a randomly generated activity from the Bored API.

We pitched our idea to a board of judges and ultimately won the hackathon.

Here are some sample images of the website:
